1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
- RTO in this case is normally between 60 and 120 seconds

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
- In this case, RDS needs to launch a new db instance, so it maybe take up to 30 minutes

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
- In this case, because we have read replica so the minimum RPO would be zero

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
- In this case, RDS needs to launch a new db instance and applies the latest db backup, so the RPO would be 5 minutes (because the transactional log is updated to S3 every 5 minutes)
